## About
This repository features a simplified fire spread simulation using Cellular Automata (CA) principles, with buildings represented as cells. The model incorporates factors such as building area, material, wind (direction and speed), building spacing, and relevant fire-blocking elements (e.g., rivers, roads, and walls).

This project originated from my course studio and serves as an exploratory approach to understanding fire dynamics in urban history district.
